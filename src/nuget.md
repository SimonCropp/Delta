Delta is an approach to implementing a [304 Not Modified](https://www.keycdn.com/support/304-not-modified) leveraging DB change tracking.<!-- include: intro. path: /docs/mdsource/intro.include.md -->

The approach uses a last updated timestamp from the database to generate an [ETag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag). All dynamic requests then have that ETag checked/applied.

This approach works well when the frequency of updates is relatively low. In this scenario, the majority of requests will leverage the result in a 304 Not Modified being returned and the browser loading the content its cache.

Effectively consumers will always receive the most current data, while the load on the server is reduced.<!-- endInclude -->
