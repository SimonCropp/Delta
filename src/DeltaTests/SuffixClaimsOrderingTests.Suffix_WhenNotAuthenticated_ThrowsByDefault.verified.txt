{
  Type: Exception,
  Message:
Delta: A suffix callback was provided but the user is not authenticated.
This usually means UseDelta is registered before UseAuthentication/UseAuthorization in the middleware pipeline.
Ensure authentication middleware runs before UseDelta so that User claims are available to the suffix callback.
Example correct ordering:
    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();
    app.UseDelta<TDbContext>(suffix: ...);

If this endpoint intentionally allows anonymous access with a suffix, set allowAnonymous: true.,
